    <p>  Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[13] Sanger coined its name,[14][15] as a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawai'ian word for "quick"[16]) and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions in other languages were quickly developed. With at least 5,922,970 articles,[note 3] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages[17] and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.[18]

        In 2005, Nature published a peer review comparing 42 hard science articles from Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and Wikipedia and found that Wikipedia's level of accuracy approached that of Britannica,[19] although critics suggested that it might not have fared so well in a similar study of a random sampling of all articles or one focused on social science or contentious social issues.[20][21] The following year, Time magazine stated that the open-door policy of allowing anyone to edit had made Wikipedia the biggest and possibly the best encyclopedia in the world, and was a testament to the vision of Jimmy Wales.[22]

        Wikipedia has been criticized for exhibiting systemic bias, for presenting a mixture of "truths, half truths, and some falsehoods",[23] and for being subject to manipulation and spin in controversial topics.[24] However, Facebook announced that by 2017 it would help readers detect fake news by suggesting links to related Wikipedia articles. YouTube announced a similar plan in 2018.[25]
